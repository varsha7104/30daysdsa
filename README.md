# Getting Started with DSA

In this repo I am going to share my dsa progress daily
Day 1:
I started with basics of the array . I have did 7 problems regarding arrays like 
1)Largest number in the array <br>
2)Second Largest number in the array <br>
3)Check if the array is sorted <br>
4)Sort 0,1,2's <br>
5)Maximum Consecutive ones <br>
6)Union of two sorted arrays <br>
7)Linear Search <br>
<br> <br> <br>
Day2:
Today I started with the some more problems of dsa . Today I have done some more easy level sums . <br>
1)Find the number that appears once<br>
2)Left Rotate an array by oneplace<br>
3)Remove duplicatesfromSorted array <br>
4)Left rotate by d places <br>
5)Right Rotate by d places <br>
6)Move zeroes to the end <br>
7)Missing number in the array <br>
Day 3:
Today I practiced the binary search . The many variations of the problems related to the binary search <br>
1)Binary Search to find X in sorted array <br>
2)Implement Lower Bound <br>
3)Implement Upper Bound <br>
4)Search Insert Position <br>
5)Floor/Ceil in Sorted Array <br>
6)Find the first or last occurrence of a given number in a sorted array <br>
7)Count occurrences of a number in a sorted array with duplicates <br><br>
Day 6:<br>
Today I practiced in basics of the recursion<br>
1)Generate all binary strings<br>
2)Generate all binary strings with no consecutive ones<br>
3)Generate Paranthesis<br>
4)Print all subsequences/Power Set<br>
5)Check if there exists a subsequence with sum K<br>
6)Combination Sum<br>
7)Combination Sum-II<br>
